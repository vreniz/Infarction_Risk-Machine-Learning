# Infarction_Risk-Machine-Learning

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk, leveraging structured datasets. Our objective was to implement and optimize machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, for pattern recognition in health data. We conducted exploratory data analysis, implemented feature selection, and optimized model hyperparameters using Grid Search and K-Nearest Neighbors imputation for missing data. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in predictive performance, with Random Forest achieving an F1-score of 0.87. These findings underline the potential of machine learning in supporting clinical decision- making.
